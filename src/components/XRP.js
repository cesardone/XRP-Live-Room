          <p className='lead'>
            XRP is a digital asset built for payments. It is the native digital
            asset on the XRP Ledgerâ€”an open-source, permissionless and
            decentralized blockchain technology that can settle transactions in
            3-5 seconds. XRP can be sent directly without needing a central
            intermediary, making it a convenient instrument in bridging two
            different currencies quickly and efficiently.
